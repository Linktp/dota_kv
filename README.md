#Dota 2 KV Package
Unlike my [Lua Snippets](https://github.com/bhargavrpatel/Dota-2-Sublime-Packages) project, this is a *Package*. The package consists of custom syntax highlighting and Snippets. The Snippets consist of all the KV pairs, modifiers, and constants. 

***

## Installation
Chose either of the methods listed below. I suggest everyone use **Method 1**
#### Method 1
I have uploaded the mod as a submission to Sublime Package Control. This means when I update the package, it will update on your system automatically.
The ideal method is as follows:
![Dota KV Package Installation via Method 1](http://fat.gfycat.com/PeskyLiquidCutworm.gif)

1. Install [Sublime Package Control ](https://sublime.wbond.net/installation)
2. Open Command Pallet (CNTRL+SHIFT+P), type "Install Package" then press Enter.
3. Once the list of packages has been cached, type "Dota KV" then press Enter.
4. Restart Sublime text. Sometimes the Snippets wont work right after the install even if you have the syntax set as Dota KV (in above gif I have it set as Conjure but even when I had set it as Dota KV the Snippets didnt show until restart)

#### Method 2
If you do not wish to install via Sublime Package Control, your version of the package will not be automatically updated when I update. The steps are as follows.

1. Download repo as a zip file. 
2. Extract all the files into a folder called "Dota KV"
3. In Sublime text, click on Preferences > Browse Packages. Move the "Dota KV" folder in the explorer instance that pops up.

## Guide
### Snippets for Functions
![Snippets V1.0.0 Demo](http://fat.gfycat.com/ObedientParallelIbis.gif)
Supported Functions so far. They are all that are listed on [Hex6's website](hex6.se/dota/modifier_functions.txt). The "Triggers" for these is same as their name. When you start typing, **first letter has to be capital.**. I plan on adding the others used in creation of heroes/units in a couple of days.

* States
* SpendCharge
* OnProjectileHit
* OnOwnerSpawned
* OnOwnerDied
* OnSpellStart
* OnToggleOn

### Completions for Constants
There are above 1400 constants that I have added. I will not list them here, you can simply open *constants.sublime-completions* in Sublime Text to see them. Unlike snippets, **constants are case agnostic**. First letter not need be capital.

#### Methods of using Constants
1. You can start typing words which you can think of and press **Cntrl + Space** to see a list. 
2. Type a completion as best you can and simply press TAB. You can then iterate over the completion by pressing TAB. 

 Here is a list which states them by category.
