============================================================================================================================================

This package is under version control via Sublime Package Control. It will be updated automatically on your system when I update my repo.
I plan on adding a plugin which adds more functionality later. There will be "Changelogs" to let you know what has been added/removed.



Usage:

			- All modifier functions such as "ApplyModifier" are added as snippets. Simply type their name (first letter capital) and press TAB\ENTER
			- All constants are added as completions. They might not show up for you automatically, depending on your settings. 
					- Simply type the name of your constant as closely as possible (I would type "state" to get "modifierState". This is not as strict in detection as Snippets.)
						- You will see popup list automatically (depends on settings). If not press CNTRL+SPACE
						- If you are feeling lucky, simlpy press TAB and it will be completed for you. You can cycle thruogh them by pressing tab over and over again


List of Constants:
Here is a list of all constants by type. Simply type the trigger (you dont need to type all of it, the order of words you type is not important unlike snippets)
	- Ability Behaviors    			TRIGGER: abilityBehavior  
	- Modifier Names      			TRIGGER: modifierName   (such as modifier_abaddon_aphotic_shield)
